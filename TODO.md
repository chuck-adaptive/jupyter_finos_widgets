# TODO

- We need to write up the development process. I suggest we put together a collection of tools to simplify things, relying on `pip` as our preferred package manager. These tools combine to give us a `develop` command that will run everything for a development environment. I'm skeptical that SAIL is our best place to run FDC3. But I am biased. How has your experience been?

- Deploy the package to pypi

- Tests

- Get off of webpack as a build tool

- python linter

- Check for

  - Is the commit signed? - can we add this to CD pipeline

- Death to all semi-colons!

- Do we need to add traitlets to the dependencies?

- Typescript compilation error

- demo notebook that integrates other widgets and components from SAIL
